# Movie_Rental_App
Movie rental web app using Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB

The application includes all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for manipulating videos titles. 

Includes search (partial search on “title”) and filtering (filter by “genre”) functionalities as well. 

Search and filter are integrated together (if a genre is selected, search for movies under selected genre).
